# Arcade-Machine
Retro game playing on emulators. Specifically, designed for the home environment.

In mid 2022 I decided to buy an Intel based NUCC. A mini-computer of sorts, which is infact quite powerful for the price. I have a...

As of recent I have gotten a new machine and am no longer using it as my main workstation altough it did for a long time. As of now my main goal is to try and use it as "Burner" Computer. Where I am free to test and have fun with it with out the worry that if somethign goes wrong I will lose some valuable data or experience dramatic downtime in my work. As of current I have expanded the Computer with a 256GB SSD where I have install a Debain based OS.

I have now created a live boot environmet running on a USB3.0 Thumb Drive (128GB). This Acts as my "Arcade Machine". Currently with an image of [Batocera Linux](https://batocera.org/). A distribution totally dedicated to create an all in one solution for people to play all the emulators with very minimal setup.

The only thing that need to be provided is games ISOs. These have become more rare to find for games under big companies, like Nintendo. With that in mind one can use the following mirror links to find some games (These sources are at the end)

To install these I recomend the easiest way being to transfer the roms onto the Thumb Drive while it is being used to run the live environment. These instructions can be found [here.](https://wiki.batocera.org/add_games_bios#adding_roms) I would discourage the Virtual Box method as it seems quite convoluted and not to work, atleast for me.

For now I just have the games I own on the Thumb Drive. This is then run by the NUCC and with my Switch Pro controller I am then able to play games on one of my monitors. The controller seems to have some slight issues with bluetooth but perhaps once again this is a "me" problem. One bonus feature also is that once you put you games on the Thumb Drive they will alawys be there.

For any more enquiries about [Batocera Linux](https://batocera.org/). I would refer to the [Batocera Documentation](https://wiki.batocera.org/start).

## Future Ideas

In the future I would like to accomplish the following goals with this project.

- Build a Physical Arcade Housing
- Try and Figure out Multiplayer
- Try and create a way to combine emulators and the internet??
  - Perhaps synchronous save states over a single platform for all your devices
  - Stream a devices emulator graphics over internet for people to watch and even interact with remotely?
